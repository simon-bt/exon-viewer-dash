# ExonViewer
### Visualise alternative splicing profile of exons

**ExonViewer** makes it fast and easy to explore alternative splicing profile of exons quantified from RNA-sequencing data using [vast-tools](https://github.com/vastgroup/vast-tools) software. With a few clicks, generate report-ready figures that summarise your experiment and download processed data for your records! 

**ExonViewer** currently supports three species:
* Homo sapiens (_VastDB v. hg38_)
* Mus musculus (_VastDB v. mm10_)
* Danio rerio  (_VastDB v. danRer10_)

Data available from [VastDB, v3](https://vastdb.crg.eu/wiki/Downloads).

The app is hosted on Render: https://exon-viewer-dash.onrender.com
